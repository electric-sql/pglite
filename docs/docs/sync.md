# Sync using ElectricSQL

At [ElectricSQL](https://electric-sql.com/) we are building a sync engine to enable realtime partial replication from Postgres to any other datastore, be it a JavaScript framework state store in a webapp, a database at the edge, or an embedded database in the mobile application.

To accompany Electric, we are developing a sync extension for PGlite that will enable you to synchronise a remote Postgres with PGlite.

The first _alpha_ version of the sync plugin can sync a "shape" from Electric into a table in your PGlite. We don't yet support local writes being synced out, or conflict resolution, but we are actively exploring the best way to enable this in a layered and extendable way.

## Using the Sync plugin _(alpha)_

To use the sync plugin, first install the `@electric-sql/pglite-sync` package:

```sh
npm install @electric-sql/pglite-sync
```

Then add it to you PGlite instance and create any local tables needed:

```ts
import { electricSync } from '@electric-sql/pglite-sync'

const pg = await PGlite.create({
  extensions: {
    electric: electricSync(),
  },
})

await pg.exec(`
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS todo (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    task TEXT,
    done BOOLEAN
  );
`)
```

You can sync data from Electric using either the single table or multi-table API.

### Single Table Sync

Use the `syncShapeToTable` method to sync a single table from Electric:

```ts
const shape = await pg.electric.syncShapeToTable({
  shape: {
    url: 'http://localhost:3000/v1/shape',
    params: {
      table: 'todo',
    },
  },
  table: 'todo',
  primaryKey: ['id'],
  shapeKey: 'todo', // or null if the shape state does not need to be persisted
})

// Stop syncing when done
shape.unsubscribe()
```

### Multi-Table Sync

The multi-table API ensures transactional consistency across tables by syncing updates that happened in a single transaction in Postgres within a single transaction in PGLite.

Use the `syncShapesToTables` method to sync multiple tables simultaneously:

```ts
const sync = await pg.electric.syncShapesToTables({
  shapes: {
    todos: {
      shape: {
        url: 'http://localhost:3000/v1/shape',
        params: { table: 'todo' },
      },
      table: 'todo',
      primaryKey: ['id'],
    },
    users: {
      shape: {
        url: 'http://localhost:3000/v1/shape',
        params: { table: 'users' },
      },
      table: 'users',
      primaryKey: ['id'],
    },
  },
  key: 'my-sync', // or null if the sync state does not need to be persisted
  onInitialSync: () => {
    console.log('Initial sync complete')
  },
})

// Stop syncing when done
sync.unsubscribe()
```

There is a full example you can run locally in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/electric-sql/pglite/tree/main/packages/pglite-sync/example).

## electricSync API

The `electricSync` plugin can be given some configuration options to allow customization of the sync process.

- `metadataSchema?: string`<br>
  The name of the Postgres schema that the shape metadata tables will be part of, defaults to `"electric"`.

- `debug?: boolean`<br>
  Enable debug logging, defaults to `false`.

## syncShapeToTable API

The `syncShapeToTable` is a relatively thin wrapper around the Electric [ShapeStream API](https://next.electric-sql.com/api/clients/typescript#shapestream) designed to do the minimal required to sync a shape _into_ a table.

It takes the following options as an object:

- `shape: ShapeStreamOptions`<br>
  The shape stream specification to sync, described by the Electric [ShapeStream API](https://electric-sql.com/docs/api/clients/typescript#shapestream) options, see the [ShapeStream API](https://electric-sql.com/docs/api/clients/typescript#options) for more details.

- `table: string`<br>
  The name of the table to sync into.

- `schema: string`<br>
  The name of the Postgres schema that the table to sync into is part of, defaults to `"public"`.

- `mapColumns: MapColumns`<br>
  An object indicating the mapping of the shape column values to your local table. This can be either a simple object of `localColumnName: shapeColumnName` mapping, or a function that takes a replication message and returns a mapping of `localColumnName: newValue`.

- `primaryKey: string[]`<br>
  An array of column names that form the primary key of the table you are syncing into. Used for updates and deletes.

- `shapeKey: string | null`<br>
  Identifier for the shape subscription - If not null, stream state will be persisted along with the data in order to allow resuming the stream between sessions.

- `initialInsertMethod: 'insert' | 'csv' | 'json'`<br>
  The method to use for the initial sync, defaults to `'insert'`. The `csv` and `json` options provide a performance boost during the initial sync.

  - `insert`: Insert the data row by row.
  - `csv`: Insert the data using the `COPY FROM` command with a CSV file.
  - `json`: Insert the data using a query that is passed the data as a JSON array.

- `useCopy: boolean`_(DEPRECATED: use `initialInsertMethod` instead)_<br>
  Whether to use the `COPY FROM` command to insert the initial data, defaults to `false`. This process may be faster than inserting row by row as it combines the inserts into a CSV to be passed to Postgres.

- `onInitialSync: () => void`<br>
  A callback that is called when the initial sync is complete.

- `onMustRefetch?: (tx: Transaction) => Promise<void>`<br>
  A callback for when the shape must be refetched after Electric sends the `must-refetch` control message. When provided, the subscription will bypass the single-shape-per-table lock and you can use the provided transaction to perform the required cleanup of synced rows before the shape data is re-inserted from scratch. This is ideal when there is clear separation of shapes, such as date ranges.

The returned `shape` object from the `syncShapeToTable` call has the following methods:

- `isUpToDate: boolean`<br>
  Indicates that the stream had caught up to the main Postgres.

- `shapeId: string`<br>
  The server side `shapeId`

- `subscribe(cb: () => void, error: (err: FetchError | Error) => void)`<br>
  A callback to indicate that the shape caught up to the main Postgres.

- `unsubscribe()`<br>
  Unsubscribe from the shape. Note that this does not clear the state that has been synced into the table.

- `stream: ShapeStream`<br>
  The underlying `ShapeStream` instance, see the [ShapeStream API](https://electric-sql.com/docs/api/clients/typescript#shapestream) for more details.

## syncShapesToTables API

The `syncShapesToTables` API allows syncing multiple shapes into multiple tables simultaneously while maintaining transactional consistency. It takes the following options:

- `shapes: Record<string, ShapeOptions>`<br>
  An object mapping shape names to their configuration options. Each shape configuration includes:

  - `shape: ShapeStreamOptions` - The shape stream specification
  - `table: string` - The target table name
  - `schema?: string` - Optional schema name (defaults to "public")
  - `mapColumns?: MapColumns` - Optional column mapping
  - `primaryKey: string[]` - Array of primary key columns

- `key: string | null`<br>
  Identifier for the multi-shape subscription. If provided, sync state will be persisted to allow resuming between sessions.

- `initialInsertMethod: 'insert' | 'csv' | 'json'`<br>
  The method to use for the initial sync, defaults to `'insert'`. The `csv` and `json` options provide a performance boost during the initial sync.

  - `insert`: Insert the data row by row.
  - `csv`: Insert the data using the `COPY FROM` command with a CSV file.
  - `json`: Insert the data using a query that is passed the data as a JSON array.

- `useCopy: boolean`_(DEPRECATED: use `initialInsertMethod` instead)_<br>
  Whether to use the `COPY FROM` command to insert the initial data, defaults to `false`. This process may be faster than inserting row by row as it combines the inserts into a CSV to be passed to Postgres.

- `onInitialSync?: () => void`<br>
  Optional callback that fires when initial sync is complete for all shapes.

- `onMustRefetch?: (tx: Transaction) => Promise<void>`<br>
  A callback for when the shape must be refetched after Electric sends the `must-refetch` control message. When provided, the subscription will bypass the single-shape-per-table lock and you can use the provided transaction to perform the required cleanup of synced rows before the shape data is re-inserted from scratch. This is ideal when there is clear separation of shapes, such as date ranges.

The returned sync object provides:

- `isUpToDate: boolean`<br>
  Whether all shapes have caught up to the main Postgres.

- `streams: Record<string, ShapeStream>`<br>
  Access to individual shape streams by their names.

- `unsubscribe()`<br>
  Stop syncing all shapes.

## Limitations

- It is currently not possible to sync multiple shapes into the same table, as shape subscriptions require being able to drop all data and start over. We are working on a fix for this case, but the current version will throw if a shape is synced into the same table more than once.

- In order to maintain transactional consistency, data is aggregated in-memory until we can guarantee its consistency, which might create a lot of memory usage for very large shapes. We are working on resolving this issue, and it is only a problem for initial syncing.
