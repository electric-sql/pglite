# Example: PGlite + Vite + React + TypeScript

This is an example of a simple project using [PGlite](https://pglite.dev) and it's [React integration](https://pglite.dev/docs/framework-hooks/react). It uses [Vite](https://vite.dev), [React](https://react.dev/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

This example demonstrates the usage of some of PGlite's React API: [PGliteProvider](https://pglite.dev/docs/framework-hooks/react#pgliteprovider), [usePGlite](https://pglite.dev/docs/framework-hooks/react#usepglite), [useLiveQuery](https://pglite.dev/docs/framework-hooks/react#uselivequery).

On page load, a database is created with a single table. On pressing the button, a new row is inserted into the database. The `useLiveQuery` will watch for any changes and display the most recently inserted 5 rows.

# Getting started with this example

## Prerequisites
You need [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (at least version 18), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.

Check node version
```
$ node --version
```
Sample output: `v20.9.0`

Check pnpm version
```
$ pnpm --version
```
Sample output: `9.15.3`

Check git version
```
$ git --version
```
Sample output: `git version 2.34.1`

## Install and run the example locally

This example depends on `PGlite` packages released on npmjs.com, so you don't need to build the entire `PGlite` project in order to run the example.

1. Get the code from GitHub. The example is in `PGlite`'s main repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/electric-sql/pglite
```
2. Navigate to this example's directory
```
$ cd ./pglite/examples/react
```
3. Install dependencies

```
$ pnpm i --ignore-workspace
```

This example is part of the `pglite` pnpm workspace, but for our needs, we do not need to install all dependencies in the workspace. Thus passing the `--ignore-workspace` flag.

4. Start a development server locally
```
$ pnpm dev
```
Sample output:
```
  VITE v6.1.0  ready in 126 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h + enter to show help
```

5. Open your browser and point to the above indicated address (http://localhost:5173/ but your address might be different)

# Getting started with PGlite + Vite + React + Typescript

If you'd like to start from scratch, here is how you can reproduce this example, so you understand better how it was made:

1. Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Run `pnpm create vite`. Follow the steps, input the name of your project (eg pglite-vite-react-project), selecte `React` for framework, `TypeScript` as variant. 

Sample output:

```
$ pnpm create vite
.../19522a4053e-20b11                    |   +1 +
.../19522a4053e-20b11                    | Progress: resolved 1, reused 1, downloaded 0, added 1, done
✔ Project name: … pglite-vite-react-project
✔ Select a framework: › React
✔ Select a variant: › TypeScript

Scaffolding project in /tmp/pglite-vite-react-project...

Done. Now run:

  cd pglite-vite-react-project
  pnpm install
  pnpm run dev
```

3. Run the steps above:

```
  $ cd pglite-vite-react-project
  $ pnpm install
  $ pnpm run dev

```

4. The last command will start an http server on your local machine. Point your browser to the indicated address:

```
$ pnpm run dev
  VITE v6.1.0  ready in 126 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h + enter to show help
```

4. Install [@electric-sql/pglite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@electric-sql/pglite) and [@electric-sql/pglite-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@electric-sql/pglite-react) npm packages:

```
$ pnpm install @electric-sql/pglite @electric-sql/pglite-react

Packages: +2
++
Downloading @electric-sql/pglite@0.2.17: 9.99 MB/9.99 MB, done
Progress: resolved 224, reused 180, downloaded 2, added 2, done

dependencies:
+ @electric-sql/pglite 0.2.17
+ @electric-sql/pglite-react 0.2.17

```

5. You are ready start using PGlite's React API.
Make sure to exclude pglite from dependency optimization using the [optimizeDeps option inside vite.config.js](https://pglite.dev/docs/bundler-support#vite).

6. Have a look at this project's `App.tsx`, `MyPGliteComponent.tsx` and `MyPGliteItemsComponent.tsx` to see how you can create a database and use PGlite React's integration and start modifying your project. Switch to the browser to see your changes.
